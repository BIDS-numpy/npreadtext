/*
 * The original code had some error details, but I assume that we don't need
 * it.  Printing the string from which we tried to modify it should be fine.
 * This should potentially be public NumPy API, although it is tricky, NumPy
 *
 * This function must support unaligned memory access.
 *
 * TODO: An earlier version of the code had unused default versions (pandas
 *       does this) when columns are missing.  We could define this either
 *       by passing `NULL` in, or by adding a default explicitly somewhere.
 *       (I think users should probably have to define the default, at which
 *       point it doesn't matter here.)
 *
 * NOTE: We are currently passing the parser config, this could be made public
 *       or could be set up to be dtype specific/private.  Always passing
 *       pconfig fully seems easier right now.
